INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.

 The archive should contain these files

        TOPAZNEW.TTF    (the font itself)
        README.TXT      (this file)

 Once unarchived, simply move the file TOPAZNEW.TTF to your
 WINDOWS/FONTS directory and that's it! You should have the
 Topaz New font available to you in your applications. (If
 not, then you may need to re-start Windows or re-start the
 application.)

FONT INFORMATION

 This font, 'Topaz New', is designed to be used at 12 points.
 At this size, on a 640x480 PC screen it is very similar to the
 Amiga Topaz font at size 8 on a 640x256 Amiga screen.

 It is designed to be used under Windows 3.1 or higher, and
 has Adobe Standard encoding.

 This version contains the ASCII characters 32-127 inclusive.
 All other printing characters are represented by a '!'.

 It is a monospaced font. That is, all the characters have the
 same width. I created this font mainly for use in viewing /
 creating ASCII art and as such I think it gives the best results
 (Well I would ;) It also makes your PC look a bit more AMIGA-like!
